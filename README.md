# Spin templates for Slack applications

Installation: `spin templates install --git https://github.com/itowlson/spin-templates-slack --upgrade`

Spin compatibility: should work with 2.3 or above but I tested with 2.4

Status: experimental.  Please report bugs or suggestions!

Note these do not set up the integration for you!  This is just the HTTP handler.  Once deployed, see the Slack docs for installing into a workspace.
